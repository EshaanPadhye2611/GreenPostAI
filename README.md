AI-Powered Swachhta & LiFE Monitoring Dashboard

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence to create a scalable, automated dashboard for monitoring cleanliness and environmental sustainability practices in post offices. It integrates real-time AI image processing to detect cleanliness deviations and LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) initiatives, triggering timely alerts and providing valuable insights. This solution aims to encourage better cleanliness and sustainable practices across post office locations, in alignment with India's Swachhta Action Plan.

Features:

📷 Real-Time Cleanliness Monitoring:
Utilizes AI for image recognition to detect garbage or untidy spaces within post office premises.

🌱 LiFE Practices Detection:
Classifies green initiatives such as the presence of solar panels, waste segregation bins, and energy-efficient lighting.

📍 Geolocation & Timestamp:
Embeds location and timestamp data in images to ensure real-time and location-specific monitoring.

⚠️ Alert System:
Automatically triggers notifications via SMS or email when cleanliness or LiFE standards are breached.

📊 Data Visualization & Analytics:
A user-friendly dashboard displays live feeds, trends, and reports for decision-makers.

Technologies:
