AI-Powered Swachhta & LiFE Monitoring Dashboard

This project leverages artificial intelligence to create a scalable, automated dashboard for monitoring cleanliness and environmental sustainability practices in post offices. It integrates real-time AI image processing to detect cleanliness deviations and LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) initiatives, triggering timely alerts and providing valuable insights. This solution aims to encourage better cleanliness and sustainable practices across post office locations, in alignment with India's Swachhta Action Plan.

Features

Real-Time Cleanliness Monitoring: Utilizes AI for image recognition to detect garbage or untidy spaces within post office premises.
LiFE Practices Detection: Classifies green initiatives such as the presence of solar panels, waste segregation bins, and energy-efficient lighting.
Geolocation & Timestamp: Embeds location and timestamp data in images to ensure real-time and location-specific monitoring.
Alert System: Automatically triggers notifications via SMS or email when cleanliness or LiFE standards are breached.
Data Visualization & Analytics: A user-friendly dashboard displays live feeds, trends, and reports for decision-makers.\

Technologies

AI Models: Pre-trained models like YOLO/SSD for object detection and image classification of green practices.
Back-End: Python with Flask to integrate AI models and handle data processing.
Alerts: Twilio API for sending SMS or email notifications to relevant stakeholders.
Front-End: PHP for dashboard development, providing a comprehensive interface for monitoring and data visualization.

Methodology

Data Collection: Collect periodic camera feed data from post offices.
AI Integration: Use object detection for cleanliness and classification models for identifying green practices.
Dashboard Development: Display live feeds, alerts, and analytical reports.
Alerts & Notifications: Threshold-based triggers for real-time alerts on cleanliness or sustainability deviations.
Data Analytics: Generate insights, reports, and trend analysis for post office management.

Benefits

Automated Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual inspections, increasing operational efficiency.
Real-Time Alerts: Facilitates quick responses to address cleanliness or environmental standard breaches.
Scalability: Can be easily implemented across multiple locations, allowing broad adoption across the network.
Data-Driven Insights: Offers actionable insights into Swachhta and sustainability efforts, enhancing decision-making.
